# Instructions  

**Collaboration:**  

Collaboration on solving the assignment is allowed, after you have thought about the problem sets on your own. It is also OK to get clarification (but not solutions) from online resources, again after you have thought about the problem sets on your own. 

There are two requirements about collaboration: 

* Cite your collaborators **fully and completely** (*e.g.*, "XXX explained to me what is asked in problem set 3"). Or cite online resources (*e.g.*, "I got inspired by reading XXX") that helped you.

* Write your scripts and report **independently** - the scripts and report must come from you only.

**Submitting your assignment:**  

* Please write a report `PS1.pdf`. 

* Create a jupyter notebook named `PS1.ipynb`. 

* Upload your jupyter notebook **and** report to your Github `ESE5023_Assignments_XXX` repository (where `XXX` is your SUSTech ID) before the due time.

**Late Submission:**  

Late submissions will **not** receive any credit. The submission time will be determined based on your latest GitHub file records.

# 1. Flowchart 

**[10 points]** Write a function `Print_values` with arguments `a`, `b`, and `c` to reflect the following flowchart. Here the purple parallelogram operator on a list `[x, y, z]` is to compute and print `x+y-10z`. Report your output with some random `a`, `b`, and `c` values.

# 2. Continuous celing function

**[10 points]** Given a `N`-elements list of positive integers. For every element `x` of the list, find the value of continuous ceiling function defined as `F(x) = F(ceil(x/3)) + 2x`, where `F(1) = 1`. 

***

# 3. Dice rolling

**3.1 [15 points]** Given `6` dice each with `6` faces, numbered from `1` to `6`. Write a function `Find_number_of_ways` to find the number of ways to get sum `x`, defined as the sum of values on each face when all the dice are thrown.

**3.2 [5 points]** Count the number of ways for any `x` from `6` to `36`, assign the number of ways to a list called `Number_of_ways`, so which `x` yields the maximum `Number_of_ways`?


***

# 4. Dynamic programming

**4.1 [5 points]** Write a function `Random_integer` to fill an array of `N` elements by randomly selecting integers from `0` to `10`.

**4.2 [15 points]** Write a function `Sum_averages` to compute the sum of the average of all subsets of the array. For example, given an array of `[1, 2, 3]`, you `Sum_averages` function should compute the sum of: average of `[1]`, average of `[2]`, average of `[3]`,  average of `[1, 2]`, average of `[1, 3]`, average of `[2, 3]`, and average of `[1, 2, 3]`.  

**4.3 [5 points]** Call `Sum_averages` with `N` increasing from `1` to `100`, assign the output to a list called `Total_sum_averages`. Plot `Total_sum_averages`, describe what do you see.

***

# 5. Path counting

**5.1 [5 points]** Create a matrix with `N` rows and `M` columns, fill the right-bottom corner and top-left corner cells with `1`, and randomly fill the rest of matrix with integer `0` or `1`.

**5.2 [25 points]** Consider a cell marked with `0` as a blockage or dead-end. Write a function `Count_path` to count total number of paths to reach the right-bottom corner cell from the top-left corner cell. 

**Notice:** for a given cell, you are **only allowed** to move either rightward or downward.

**5.3 [5 points]** Let `N = 10, M = 8`, run `Count_path` for `1000` times, each time the matrix (except the right-bottom corner and top-left corner cells, which remain being `1`) is re-filled with integer `0` or `1` randomly, report the mean of total number of paths from the `1000` runs.
