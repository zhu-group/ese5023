# `Python` libraries for data visualization

Here we go over some popular libraries for data visualization that are commonly used these days. They allow us to create visual data models easily according to their specifications by conveniently providing an interface, data visualization tools all in one place.

## `Matplotlib`

By any measure, [`Matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/index.html) is the most popular and widely-used plotting library in the Python community. It's most useful in making 2-D plots. We have a [section](https://zhu-group.github.io/ese5023/Section_08.html) about this library. 

## `Seaborn`

[`Seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) is based on `Matplotlib` and closely integrated with the `NumPy` and `pandas` data structures. `Seaborn` has various dataset-oriented plotting functions that operate on data frames and arrays that have whole datasets within them. Then it internally performs the necessary statistical aggregation and mapping functions to create informative plots that the user desires. It is a high-level interface for creating beautiful and informative **statistical graphics** that are integral to exploring and understanding data. The `Seaborn` data graphics can include bar charts, pie charts, histograms, scatterplots, error charts, etc. `Seaborn` also has various tools for choosing color palettes that can reveal patterns in the data.

## `Altair`

[`Altair`](https://altair-viz.github.io/) is also a statistical data visualization library in Python. It is based on [Vega and Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega/) which are a sort of declarative language for creating, saving, and sharing data visualization designs that are also interactive. `Altair` can be used to create beautiful data visualizations of plots such as bar charts, pie charts, histograms, scatterplots, error charts, power spectra, stemplots, etc. using a minimal amount of coding. You can open `Jupyter Notebook` or `JupyterLab` and execute any of the code to obtain that data visualizations in `Altair`. 

Browse [`Altair` gallery](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html).

## `Bokeh`

[`Bokeh`](https://bokeh.org/) is a data visualization library that provides detailed graphics with a high level of **interactivity** across various datasets, whether they are large or small. `Bokeh` is based on The Grammar of Graphics like `ggplot` but it is native to `Python` while `ggplot` is based on `ggplot2` from `R`. Data visualization experts can create various interactive plots for modern web browsers using `bokeh` which can be used in interactive web applications, HTML documents, or JSON objects. 

`Bokeh` has 3 levels that can be used for creating visualizations. The first level focuses only on creating the data plots quickly, the second level controls the basic building blocks of the plot while the third level provides full autonomy for creating the charts with no pre-set defaults. This level is suited to the data analysts and professionals that are well versed in the technical side of creating data visualizations.

Browse [`Bokeh` demos](https://demo.bokeh.org/).

## `Plotly`

[`Plotly`](https://plotly.com/) is a free open-source graphing library that can be used to form data visualizations. It's built on top of the `Plotly` JavaScript library and can be used to create **web-based data visualizations** that can be displayed in Jupyter notebooks or web applications using Dash or saved as individual HTML files. 

`Plotly` provides more than 40 unique chart types like scatter plots, histograms, line charts, bar charts, pie charts, error bars, box plots, multiple axes, sparklines, dendrograms, 3-D charts, contour plots, etc. It can be used offline with no internet connection.

Browse [`Plotly` gallery](https://dash.gallery/Portal/) to discover things you would be interested in.

## `Pygal`

[`Pygal`](https://www.pygal.org/en/stable/) is a `Python` data visualization library that is made for creating great charts! While `Pygal` is similar to `Plotly` or `Bokeh` in that it creates data visualization charts that can be embedded into web pages and accessed using a web browser, a primary difference is that it can output charts in the form of **SVG’s or Scalable Vector Graphics**. These SVG’s ensure that you can observe your charts clearly without losing any of the quality even if you scale them.  

## `Cartopy`

[`Cartopy`](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/) makes use of the powerful `PROJ`, `numpy`, and `shapely` modules and includes a programmatic interface built on top of `matplotlib` for the creation of publication-quality maps. We have a [section](https://zhu-group.github.io/ese5023/Section_09.html) about this library. 

Browse [`Cartopy` gallery](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/gallery/index.html).

## `Geoplotlib`

[`Geoplotlib`](https://github.com/andrea-cuttone/geoplotlib) supports the creation of geographical maps in particular with many different types of maps available such as dot-density maps, choropleths, symbol maps, etc. One thing to keep in mind is that requires `NumPy` and `pyglet` as prerequisites before installation.  

In conclusion, all these `Python` Libraries for Data Visualization are great options for creating beautiful and informative data visualizations. Each of these has its strong points and advantages so you can select the one that is perfect for your data visualization or project. For example, `Matplotlib` is extremely popular and well suited to general 2-D plots while `cartopy` and `Geoplotlib` are uniquely suite to geographical visualizations. So go on and choose your library to create a stunning visualization in Python!

## `Folium`

[`Folium`](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) makes it easy to visualize data on an interactive leaflet map. The library has a number of built-in tilesets from OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, and Stamen. Even though Plotly, Altair, and Bokeh also enable us to create maps, Folium uses an open street map to give you a closer feeling to a Google Map with minimum code.

Each of these has its strong points and advantages so you can select the one that is perfect for your data visualization or project.

# `Python` next?

So far we have covered the basics of `Python` and fundamental modules to make plots and analyze data. Looking forward, the learning curve is still steep, be patient as it takes time. Use Google and [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) without hesitation, as you will find 9 out 10 times your questions/issues have been reported and solved (luckily) already.

Have fun!
