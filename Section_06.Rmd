# Introduction to `pandas`

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is an open-source library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. `Pandas` is particularly suited to the analysis of **tabular** data, i.e. data that can go into a table. In other words, if you can imagine the data in an Excel spreadsheet, then `pandas` is the tool for the job.

As we covered in [Section 03](https://zhu-group.github.io/ese5023/Section_03.html#What_is_Python), python is the fastest growing and most widely used programming language in the world. This growth is driven by the data science packages such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and especially `pandas`. 

Some highlights of `pandas` (from [`pandas` website](https://pandas.pydata.org/about/)):

+ A fast and efficient **DataFrame** object for data manipulation with integrated indexing;

+ Tools for **reading and writing data** between in-memory data structures and different formats: `CSV` and text files, Microsoft `Excel`, `SQL` databases, and the fast `HDF5` format;

+ Intelligent **data alignment** and integrated handling of **missing data**: gain automatic label-based alignment in computations and easily manipulate messy data into an orderly form;

+ Flexible **reshaping** and pivoting of data sets;

+ Intelligent label-based **slicing**, **fancy indexing**, and **subsetting** of large data sets;

+ Columns can be inserted and deleted from data structures for **size mutability**;

+ Aggregating or transforming data with a powerful **group by** engine allowing split-apply-combine operations on data sets;

+ High performance **merging** and **joining** of data sets;

+ **Hierarchical axis indexing** provides an intuitive way of working with high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional data structure;

+ **Time series**-functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting, and lagging. Even create domain-specific time offsets and join time series without losing data;

+ Highly **optimized for performance**, with critical code paths written in `Cython` or `C`.

+ `Python` with `pandas` is in use in a wide variety of **academic and commercial domains**, including Finance, Neuroscience, Economics, Statistics, Advertising, Web Analytics, and more.

# `Pandas` basics

In this section, we will go over the **basic capabilities** of `pandas`.

`Pandas` is a **very deep** library, please dig into the [`pandas` documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) for more advanced usage.

## Import `pandas`

`pandas` should be installed along with `Anaconda`. To import it, run:

```{python, eval=F}
# import pandas 
import pandas as pd
# import numpy
import numpy as np
# import matplotlib
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
# make plots appear and be stored within the notebook
%matplotlib inline
```

## `Pandas` data structures: series

A *series* represents a **one-dimensional array** of data. The main difference between a series and `numpy` array is that a series has an **index**. The index contains the labels that we use to access the data.

There are many ways to [create a Series](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html). We will just show a few.

Let's create a `pandas` series to store AQI (`2023-10-25 10:00`) at Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen with `city` as the index :

```{python, eval=F}
# AQI of 4 cities on 10/25/2023
city = ['Beijing', 'Shanghai', 'Guangzhou', 'Shenzhen']
aqi  = [172, 151, 157, 97]

# Create a pandas series
my_data = pd.Series(aqi, index=city)

# Show the series using "city" as the index
my_data
```

You can show the series or even plot it:

```{python, eval=F}
# Plot the series as bars
my_data.plot(kind='bar')
```

Here we use `pandas` [built-in functions `plot`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/visualization.html) to plow the series as vertical bars (`kind='bar'`). Feel free to try other kinds (e.g., `barh`, `hist`, `box`, `area`, `pie`, etc.)

Arithmetic operations and most `numpy` functions can be applied to a series. An important point is that the series keeps their index during such operations. For example:

```{python, eval=F}
# Apply operations and functions
# The values make no sense, just for demonstration

np.log(my_data) / my_data**2
```

Here are some useful functions to get access a series and its information:

```{python, eval=F}
# Get access the index object
my_data.index

# Get access the values
my_data.values

# Get values using the index via .loc attribute
my_data.loc['Shenzhen']

my_data.loc[['Shenzhen', 'Beijing']]

# Or by row position via .iloc
my_data.iloc[0]

# .iloc is left inclusive but right exclusive
my_data.iloc[0:2]

```

## `Pandas` data structures: dataframe

Series are limited to a single "column". A more useful Pandas data structure is the `DataFrame`. A DataFrame is basically a bunch of series that share the same index. It's a lot like a table in a spreadsheet.

In this part, let's use the [hourly meteorological data](https://zhu-group.github.io/ese5023/download/Met_2020.csv) observed in 2020 at Xichong, Shenzhen. Download the `Met_2020.csv` file, and move it to your working directory.

### Read `csv` file

To read a `csv` file, use the `read_csv()` function from the `pandas` module:

```{python, eval=F}
# Read a csv file
met = pd.read_csv("Met_2020.csv")
```

Here `pandas` read the `Met_2020.csv` file, and save the object as a data frame named `met`. Here are some functions to check a data frame:

```{python, eval=F}
# Check information
met.info()

# Show column names
met.columns

# Show header
met.head()
met.head(10)

# Show tail
met.tail()
met.tail(10)

# Basic statistics
met.describe()

# Get access to a specific column
met['P']
```

Similar to series, a dataframe can also be handled with `loc` and `iloc`:

```{python, eval=F}
# Get access to a certain index(es)
met.loc[100:110]

# Get access to a certain row(s) and column(s)
met.iloc[1:4,2:6]
```

### Conditional choosing

You may notice that some rows contain `-999.0`, which stands for `NaN` data or missing data. We can select those rows:

```{python, eval=F}
# Display which rows contain NA pressure values
met.loc[ met['P'] == -999 ]
```

Or do more advanced filtering:

```{python, eval=F}
# Use & or |
met.loc[ (met['P'] == -999) & (met['T'] == -999) ]

# More advanced filtering
met.loc[ (met['P'] > 1000) & (met['T'] < 30) ]

# Contains a certain str
met.loc[met['Time'].str.contains('13:00')]

```

### Sorting

To sort a column or more columns:

```{python, eval=F}
# Sort in ascending order
met.sort_values("T")

# Sort in descending order
met.sort_values("WS", ascending=False)

# Sort more than one columns
met.sort_values(["RH", "T"], ascending=[1, 1])

```

### Adding/droping columns

To add one column:

```{python, eval=F}
# Check head
met.head()

# Creating a new column: number density
met['ND'] = met['P']*100*6.02e23/8.314/met['T']*1e-6

# Check again
met.head()

# Drop the column ND
met = met.drop(columns=['ND'])

# Check again
met.head()

```

### Reseting index

```{python, eval=F}
# Making a new dataframe
met2 = met.loc[ (met['P'] > 1000) & (met['T'] < 30) & (met['T'] > 25) ]

# Using the original index
met2

# Reset index and keeping the original index
#met2.reset_index()

# Reset index and discarding the original index
met2.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)
met2
```

### Saving to files

We can save a dataframe to `csv`, `text`, or `xlsx` files:

```{python, eval=F}
# Only use a few columns
met2 = met[['T', 'P', 'WS']]

# Check head
met2.head()

# Save to a csv file with index
met2.to_csv('Met_2020_new1.csv')

# Save to a csv file without index
met2.to_csv('Met_2020_new2.csv', index=False)

# Save to a xlsx file 
met2.to_excel('Met_2020_new3.xlsx', index=False)

# Save to txt file, separated by tab
met2.to_csv('Met_2020_new4.txt', index=False, sep='\t')
```

### Group by

Let's first create some categorical data for wind direction and remove missing data:

```{python, eval=F}

# Make a new column
met['WD_new'] = 'N'

# Assign wind directions
met.loc[ (met['WD'] <= 135 ) & (met['WD'] > 45 ), ['WD_new'] ] = 'E'
met.loc[ (met['WD'] <= 225 ) & (met['WD'] > 135 ), ['WD_new'] ] = 'S'
met.loc[ (met['WD'] <= 315 ) & (met['WD'] > 225 ), ['WD_new'] ] = 'W'

# Remove missing data
met = met.loc[ (met['WS']!=-999) & (met['WD']!=-999) & 
               (met['T']!=-999)  & (met['RH']!=-999) & 
               (met['P']!=-999)  & (met['Precip']!=-999) ]
met.head()
```

Now let's group data by `WD_new`:

```{python, eval=F}

# Group by WD_new
met.groupby(['WD_new']).mean()

# Group by followed by sorting
met.groupby(['WD_new']).mean().sort_values('T', ascending=True)
```

We can also create a new column `Hour` to save observation hours:

```{python, eval=F}
# Get the observation hour as a new column
met['Hour'] = pd.to_datetime(met['Time']).dt.hour

met.head()

# Group by the observation hour, get hourly means, then plot
met.groupby(['Hour']).mean()['T'].plot()

# Group by the observation hour then by wind direction
met.groupby(['Hour', 'WD_new']).mean()

```
